[p5.js](http://p5js.org/) has evolved out of [Processing](https://processing.org/), perhaps the most important toolkit geared towards teaching artists to program. For nearly 15 years Processing [has promoted software literacy, particularly within the visual arts, and visual literacy within technology](https://processing.org/overview/). During that time artists from all over the world have been using it to make [brilliant new works of interactive and generative art.](https://processing.org/exhibition/)

During the summer of 2014, [Lauren McCarthy](http://lauren-mccarthy.com/) and a community of enthused artists and programmers began working on p5.js, a version of Processing that was written in JavaScript, the scripting language of the web. JavaScript as a language has undergone a recent renaissance and has strongly positioned itself as one of today's most popular and flexible languages. Using p5.js also means that we can host and share the sketches that we make on the web.
