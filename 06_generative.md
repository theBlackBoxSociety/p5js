In this chapter, we take a look at some historical examples of computer art by rewriting or translating them into contemporary programming languages. This selection is inspired, but not limited, by the [ReCode project](http://recodeproject.com/).

All processing sketches [are here](code/). The translation to p5.js is yet to be done.
