# P5.JS â€¢ Gear Up

## What software to use
There are a number of ways to write p5.js sketches. Because p5.js is just a JavaScript library under the hood, you can include it in any regular web page, and even use it in conjunction with other JavaScript libraries. 
We will use a code editor (Atom) later but we'll start with the online p5.js Web Editor.    

- Make a account on the [p5.js Web Editor](https://editor.p5js.org/) 
- Download [Atom](https://atom.io) (if you haven't done yet) and install these two community packages: [p5js-toolbar](https://github.com/bmoren/p5js-toolbar) & [p5js-snippets](https://github.com/bmoren/p5js-snippets) and [the library files](https://p5js.org/download/)

## Mindset
Disclaimer, this is going to be hard. It will take time and persistence. But calm down. You do not have not become a master of the art of code. 

Coding is a type of writing. Like all types of writing, code has specific rules. But, unlike, writing a note or message to a friend, you need to be very precise and careful. One misplaced character is often the difference between a program that runs and one that doesn't. 

It's perfect to start by copying, modifying and merging code examples and ideas from others. Writing Frankencode can be very satisfactory at times! Stitching, possibly unrelated, bits and pieces code together making it achieve, although barely, its function, being prone to errors. Much like Frankenstein's monster. 

However, it is important that you type (and not copy - paste) the code examples during this lesson. Syntax is something that you need to get the hang of. Train that muscle memory.
